            <h3>SoCoMexFest is a festival that celebrates Mexican heritage and culture in Sonoma County. Sonoma County has a 30% population of Latinos according to the U.S. Census. Latinos deserve lots of spotlight in Sonoma County for their cultural contribution. This festival is sponsored by the Hispanic Federation, a nonprofit membership organization that supports Latinos with immigration, health, education, and civic engagement. All ticket sales from this festival are partially donated Sonoma County Latinos in monetary need for immigration fees, welfare, education, housing, and more. Look for the Event tab for exciting events! See you there! </h3>
